# Convergence Bot
Convergence bot is a bot written in Kotlin designed to bridge the gap
between communication in different chat protocols.

Currently planned protocols:
- Facebook Messenger
- Discord

Protocols will be implemented as plugins for the bot, thus allowing for
additional protocols to be added. Command registration will allow for
commands to be specific to a protocol, or generic across all protocols.

The bot will support a variety of commands, and aliases to make custom ones.
