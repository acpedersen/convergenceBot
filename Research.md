### TODO

### Stage 1
- Figure out dynamic class loading in kotlin - DONE
- Write up interface for each chat protocol - Documented, not implemented

### Stage 2
- Implement command registration - Documented, not implemented
    - Allow commands to be limited by protocol if necessary
- Implement alias registration - Documented, not implemented.
    - Make sure aliases can only execute commands they have access to in their scope (it must be supported on the protocol)

### Stage 3
- Implement bot for each chat protocol
- Make bot implement the core interface

### Stage 4
- Add richer integration with individual protocols

### Stage 5+
- Go back to stage 3 with a different protocol
